## Pytorch Install Locally

PyTorch requirements vary by operating system and CUDA requirements, so it's recommended to install PyTorch first following instructions at <https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally>.
That's mean "安装YOLOv8/ultralytics之前，现根据上面Pytorch本地安装的指引，先安装Pytorch。然后再安装YOLOv8/ultralytics。"
